# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Owais 🚀

![Developer](https://media.giphy.com/media/L8K62iTDkzGX6/giphy.gif)

I'm a **JavaScript and ASP.NET developer** who doesn't just create web applications but gives them a soul. The browser is my canvas, and the code is my paintbrush.

## 🔭 On my workbench... 

* **NextJs and NodeJs** are helping me craft a personal portfolio website, a dynamic showcase of my journey.
* With **ASP.NET Core 7 and SignalR**, I'm building a chat application that brings people together, byte by byte.
* Using **Angular**, I'm creating a community web application, a digital agora for the modern age.

## 🌱 Seeds I'm planting...

* Diving deep into the seas of **TypeScript and NextJs**.
* Unlocking the cryptic mysteries of **BlockChain**.
* Exploring the vast digital landscapes of the **Metaverse**.
